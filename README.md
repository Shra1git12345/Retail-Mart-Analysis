# Retail-Mart-Analysis Using SQL
Problem statement: Imagine that a retail company, such as DMart, approaches you for creating a data model to help it understand its consumer behaviour. The creation of a data model involves the following steps:

Designing an ERD.
Creating a schema and adding the relevant tables, columns, constraints and relationships.
Inserting the data values into the tables.
Querying this database to reveal valuable insights.
 

Keep this problem statement in mind. You will break it down and solve each part as you progress through this session. In this project, let’s look at some possible data points that can be captured for the problem statement.
Let’s analyse the following data points that you can capture when designing a data model for a problem statement.

Sales transactions: This dimension table will consist of the fact table and record the transactions that occur at a retail store, such as the customer ID of the buyer, date of purchase and bill amount.
Product details: This dimension table will describe the details of a purchased product, such as the model name and manufacturing date.
Customer information: This dimension table will describe the details of the customer involved in a transaction, such as their name, email address, gender and age.
Employee information: This dimension table will consist of information about each employee, such as their salary, branch location, shift timing and department.
Product inventory inflow: This dimension table will capture data related to the influx of a product, such as quantity procured by the store and quantity sold to consumers.
Branch details: This dimension table will store data for each branch, such as its location and size.
Campaigns/Discounting information: This dimension table will store information about specific campaigns that the chain may run, such as ‘buy one, get one free’.
Details of customer complaints: This dimension table will capture data about any complaints that a customer may raise, such as complaint ID, complaint details, issue date, resolution date, etc.
 

You must have understood that deciding and capturing various data points from multiple sources is an exhaustive process and must be done with due care, as the entire model is based on the data points.
